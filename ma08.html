	<h2 class="h2-assignment">MANDATORY ASSIGNMENT 08:</h2>
	<h1 class="h1-assignment">BRANDING & PACKAGING</h1>
	
	<p>
		Develop a dog food brand complete with name, logo, brochure with illustrations and infographic, design packaging and make a life-size mockup. 
		<br><br>
		All elements are presented in a separate brand manual.
		<br><br>

		<strong>NOTE:</strong> I’ve made two changes to this assignment since I first delivered it:

		1. I used a free mockup-template to show the brochure in a realistic environment:

		2. I designed a 3D mockup of a «Point of Sale» using Adobe Dimension.

	<h3 class="h3-assignment">ASSIGNMENT REPORT</h3>
	
	
	
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">TARGET AUDIENCE</h4>
	
	<p>
		Dog owners aged 18 to 40 (millennials and young adults) who uses social media and pics up on typical internet humor like memes.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">INSPIRATION METHODS</h4>
	
	<p>
		Inspiration for the tasks comes from being amongst the target audience 830 years old, owner of two dogs and a big consumer og internet humor and memes). To me all dog food branding look a little to similar to each other, so I wanted to make something that stood out from the crowd.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">THE NAME</h4>
	
	<p>
		I wanted the name to be light-hearted and interesting to communicate the brand as down to earth and to separate it from other dog food brands like Royal Canine and Pedigree Pal.
		<br><br>
		After brainstorming I decided to name the brand YO DAWG FOOD. It’s a play on word, meaning both HEY MAN (slang and also used in Xzibit memes) and YOUR DOGS FOOD. Since dogs
		usually bring lots of joy to peoples lives, I wanted to incorporate some humor into the branding.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">LOGO</h4>
	
	<p>
		I wanted the logo and brand name to be cohesive. I had an idea of a dog showing to fingers like a peace-sign, but since dogs have paws I removed to «pillows» from a paw, replicat- ing a hand showing to fingers. I invested a lot of time to form the paw perfectly. Not to edgy, not to round. It had to work in a very small size a well as super sized.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">TYPOGRAPHY</h4>
	
	<p>
		For the typeface I used HOUSE SLANT via TypeKit. This font is fitting in regards to the form of the logo and what it communicates (witty and casual). I tried to incorporate the name into the logo itself, but this would ultimately restrict me in using the logo by itself without any type.
	</p>
	
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">PACKAGE DESIGN</h4>
	
	<p>
		As mentioned earlier, all design elements and products are ment to act as extensions of the logo and brand-name.
		<br><br>
		For the packaging material I chose a food pouch that has a cardboard-like material on the outer layer. The original design has a white/transparent background, but due to the package material the
		background is displayed brown like a cardboard.
		<br><br>
		All info form the brochure is brought to the package design, but the layout is rearranged. The front of the package has a similar setup as the brochure. The back reads from top to bot- tom instead across a 2-page spread like in the brochure.
		<br><br>
		All of the three flavours are printed on the same material (therefore same background colour), but has their own colour added to logo, text and graphic. The logos have their own mini-animal icon inside to display with animal flavour the food has.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">BROCHURE WITH INFOGRAPHIC AND ILLUSTRATION</h4>
	
	<p>
		The name and logo are the main and core elements in the products branding. Every design element should be an  extensions of these two things, like the brochure.
		<br><br>
		Beside the wordmark, the logo consists of an minimalistic icon. I designed the brochures graphic in the same style by developing icons that complemented the info I placed them by. The icons are easy to understand for the reader and makes the brochure more interesting to look at. It also communicates the witty and light-hearted feel like the logo and product name.
		<br><br>
		The copy is displayed with the same typeface as the brand-name and is easy to read, both in size and
		language. It contains practical information and some subtle humor.
		<br><br>
		I went with a clean design by keeping the background white and using a brown colour for the text an graphic. This colour is the same as the design for the cow flavoured food.
		<br><br>
		This flavour is what I would expect to sell the most of. Since brown is also considered as a common colour for dogs, I found it most fitting for the brochure. The different flavoured foods has their own colour for logo, type and graphic
		<br><br>
		It also communicates which flavour the food has; cow (brown), chicken (orange) or fish (gray/blue).
		The general layout consist of a good amount of whitespace with big sized copy and icons, making it easy to read. All information about nutrition and ingredients are either made up or copied from a can of dog-food I found in my kitchen.

	<h4 class="h4-assignment">CHANGES MADE IN THE ASSIGNMENT</h4>
	
	<p>
		As mentioned earlier, I didn’t include a Point of Sale in the original MA 08 assignment I delivered. I Used Adobe Dimension to design and render a 3D mockup of a shelf that I designed decoration for. It’s hard to see, but both the top, back and inside the shelfs are covered with my designs.
		<br><br>
		I also didn’t make a 3D mockup of the brochure in the original assignment I delivered. I used a free PSD template to create this by pasting in my own designs.
