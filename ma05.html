	<p>
		The task was to design an online menu for a restaurants website. The content for the menu was attached with the assignment. I could choose between a pizza menu and a sushi menu. I chose the pizza menu.
		<br><br>
		The menu was to be well designed and appealing. It was to be coded using HTML and CSS, and I was free to use my own images and graphics.
		<br><br>
		Since it was a menu, I went with a straightforward setup listing all the menu items in columns. The site is responsive, collapsing columns when viewed on screens with lower resolution.
		<br><br>
		The overall style is meant to give the audience a feel of an urban piz- za place. I designed it minimalistic, but with texture in both font and background to give the audience a feeling of handmade quality.
		<br><br>
		The target group is the visitors of the website; hungry people looking for a delicious meal and good
		atmosphere while eating it.

	<h4 class="h4-assignment">RESEARCH</h4>
	
	<p>
		In my opinion, there are a lot of noisy and badly designed
		pizza menus being used by restaurants. I wanted to set this menu apart from the others with a clean and easy-to-read
		design, without looking neither too sterile or fancy. This is a pizza place for everyone and people should realize it the instant they look at the menu.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">DESIGN</h4>
	
	<p>
		Since I was going for a clean design and textured elements I only used one picture; the background for the entire menu. It’s a rock, which is a way of saying these pizza’s are made in a stone oven, which again gives the feeling of handmade quality. Stone oven pizza’s appeal to people of all walks of life, and is coherent with the target audience.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">COMPOSITION, LAYOUT, GRID</h4>
	
	<p>
		The main title is placed on the top in a big size to show what the page contains.
		<br><br>
		The ingress is placed after the main title in a small type to show it’s less important.
		<br><br>
		The menu items is placed in a random order after one another. They are equally important and 
		herefore placed and formatted the same. Though the price may be less important for some
		readers/potential customers than the description of the pizzas, it has a bigger size than the description so it can be easily located when skimming the menu.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">TYPOGRAPHY</h4>
	
	<p>
		The typeface I used is a display font called KUST (free for
		commercial use). Personally I have a soft spot for handwritten fonts, and though the creator brands this particular one as cold and Nordic, I think it fits well with the overall design. It’s the only one used on the menu, and to contrast and create a hierarchic I varied the size and color of the type.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">COLOURS</h4>
	
	<p>
		The dark grey stone background is a neutral background that I darkened in Photoshop to make the text easier to read.
		<br><br>
		For the type I used yellow for the most important info (tittle and pricing), white for the second most important (description) and the grey for the ingress above the menu-items.
		<br><br>
		Less colors = less noise and easier on the readers eyes.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">CODING</h4>
	
	<p>
		As mentioned earlier, I coded in HTML and CSS using Dreamweaver. The HTML document is set up in a minimalistic way with only the content needed to display the menu as I wish. There are no SEO search meta-data of any kind included in the head section of the HTML document.
		<br><br>
		The CSS document is also set up in a basic chronological order. I used a code-snippet from Stackoverflow to make the background display as I wished on my iPhone. Background-attached:fixed worked fine on desktop browser, but not on IOS Safari. I also used code-snippets from Dreamweaver to display the site as I wished on different monitories/devices with the @media attribute.
		<br><br>
		From a technical perspective, it was challenging to place the different menu item-elements as I wished inside the column (dish-container). I had great help in a Flexbox-tutorial from the YouTube-channel DevTips.
