		<br><br>

	<h4 class="h4-assignment">STRATEGIC DESIGN</h4>
	
	<p>
		I’ve designed a minimalistic map that displays the main parts of Bergen, with clearly marked bicycle routes. The routes are coloured in 4 different hues. Information about the routes is displayed on the side of the maps, wrapped in boxes with colours matching the relevant routes. The poster and the website have the same basic design.
		<br><br>
		Target audience are males 30-45 years old. Attended collage, has a 600-700K income, works at an office, loves being fit and working out. Googles whenever they need information and uses maximum 8 seconds trying to find the information they need in one place/website. They need their information in a complicated form and they need it fast!
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">DESIGN</h4>
	
	<p>
		Personally, I don’t like the typical designs of maps and guides for routes and such in cities. They are often out dated, have way to many elements and to much information. It often makes me not want to look things up because I end up using a long time trying to find an answer to a simple question. I don’t want to think, I just want to know.
		<br><br>
		That is the main theme of my style: Don’t make people think. Especially the ones that are in a hurry.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">COMPOSITION, LAYOUT, GRID</h4>
	
	<p>
		Both the poster and website have the logo, title, links and map centred. The reader is supposed to start at the top, look down on the map and then look at the routes and information about it, guided by the matching colours. The information about the routes is placed on the sides of the map and close by its belonging route. The boxes of information are not place on any form of line, and this is to make it easier for the reader to separate them from each other, in addition to the separate colours.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">ANALYSIS</h4>
	
	<p>
		Bergen has a site for cycelists: <a class="source-link" href="https://www.sykkelbyenbergen.no">https://www.sykkelbyenbergen.no</a>
		<br><br>
		The website provides a lot of useful information for cyclists. Google maps, clear instructions, articles with tips and information about happenings related to cycling in Bergen.
		<br><br>
		My website will mainly be based around the poster I designed. It’s meant to inform about four main cycle routes in Bergen,with basic information about distances, estimated time, type of road and intersections. 
		<br><br>
		My website is the opposite of <a class="source-link" href="https:// www.sykkelbyenbergen.no/sykkelruter/">https:// www.sykkelbyenbergen.no/sykkelruter/</a>. It’s not meant to
		contain more information then necessary.
		<br><br>
		Think of SykkelBergen.no as Facebook, rich with all sorts of information and inspiration. And think of my site as Twitter; short, sweet and to the point.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">COLOURS</h4>
	
	<p>
		The two main colours of the design are grey and white. The grey is meant to 
		replicate concrete, like we see on a lot of buildings in urban areas.
		<br><br>
		The bicycle routes are in blue, green, yellow and red, with strong hues. They are easy to spot on the grey background, and information about the individual routes are wrapped in squares with colours that match the belonging routes, making it easy for the readers to orientate them self.

	<div class="color-box-container">
		<div class="color-box-1">#006eff</div>
		<div class="color-box-2">#05a94b</div>
		<div class="color-box-3">#fdbc11</div>
		<div class="color-box-4">#ed2524</div>
		<div class="color-box-5">#666666</div>
		<div class="color-box-6">#ffffff</div>
		
	</div>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">TYPOGRAPHY</h4>
	
	<p>
		I used the typeface is Helvetica Neue in different weights throughout the design;
		<br><br>
		Regular, light and thin.
		<br><br>
		They have a modern look that matches the thin lines of both the logo and the map, making the overall design look cohesive. City brochures often feel out dated (in my opinion) and I want this map to stand out by having a minimalistic and modern look.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">CREATIVE METHODS</h4>
	
	<p>
		To get the custom map I wanted I used screenshots from Google Maps and another map that showed the main parts of Bergen, imported them into Adobe Illustrator, turned down the opacity and drew upon them in a new layer.
		For the bicycle routes I plotted in the names of where the routes should start, mentioned in the assignment, and the city centre of Bergen in Google Maps and took screenshots. Then I layered them in Illustrator and drew the different routes in different colours.
		<br><br>
		I also went the extra mile by designing a custom logo for the poster and website. In hindsight this was way to time consuming, but I think the minimalistic logo does its job well by communicating cycling in urban environment. It integrates bicycling, mountains and city architecture and fits well with the minimalistic style of the typeface and the map.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">WEBSITE</h4>
	
	<p>
		As mentioned earlier, the overall design of the site is the same as the poster. I added links to press so the page scrolls down to the related information box.
		<br><br>
		The map is exported from Illustrator as an SVG-file. I copied the code an pasted directly inside the HTML index-file. By doing so I could create an id attribute inside the SVG-element to link the buttons on the top of the page. The logo is a PNG-file and all text is set to a font-family that priorities Helvetica Neue, but searches for alternatives with the reader, depending on the browser-units OS.
