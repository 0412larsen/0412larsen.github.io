		First of all let me just say there is no way I’ve could have learned graphic design on my own. I don’t have the discipline to force my self to do both the fun stuff and the not-so-fun stuff in adition to work a fulltime job and trying to keep up with family life. Having deadlines, classmates and teachers has made me force my self to get through this course when I lacking motivation the most.
		<br><br>
		My true passion that I was able to learn on the side while I was
		studying design was video production. Before I started studying graphic design I had video as a passion and hobby. After starting my studies I realized that design and video are two superpowers when creating content for social media. I’ve could not have chosen a more fitting course for me since I want to become a full-time content
		creator.
		<br><br>
		As I’m writing this me and my wife are getting ready to move from Sunnmøre Norway to L’Albir in Spain. I just got a job as head of
		marketing for a small Norwegian real estate agency located in
		Guardamar in Spain. I’ve would never have gotten this job if hadn’t studied design. In addition I plan on doing design and video gigs as a freelancer, as we’ll as continuing to create content through personal projects.
