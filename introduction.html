	<p>
		<br><br>
		This portfolio contains the main assignments from my second semester as a graphic design student. 
		<br><br>
		Before every main assignment I have been introduced to the relevant subjects, tutored and challenged via weekly assignments that I have posted on my reflection blog:

		<br><br>
		My main outcome from the first semester was a basic understanding for design-
		principles and a sense for the esthetic. This has also been a curse because now I’m able to to see how bad both my early work and some of my current work is.
		<br><br>
		In the feedback for my first portfolio, it said that the design of the portfolio itself should have shown more of my design-personality. In this new portfolio I’m trying just that by going over my personal design-work to see what design-elements, fonts and colors I use on the average.
		<br><br>
		I still consider my self a newbie designer making the most out of basic design-
		principles, but now I have the ability to critic my self in a better way then before by learning from my past mistakes.
		<br><br>
		As a side-project I designed the packaging to a low-carb ice-cream for a
		highscholl-class who had it as a project.
		<br><br>
		I linked a video that shows how I took the product photo below:
