	<h1 class="h1-assignment">STUDIO SHOOTING</h1>
	
	<p>
		A new Internet radio station needs advertisement. I could choose between three different types of stations.
		<br><br>
		I chose a station that plays music from “up and coming” artists operating in the electronica and indie genres, over the two other stations that plays comedic content and political debates.
		<br><br>		
		The station wants one online ad (on Spotify) and one print ad (on various public transport platforms). It’s up to me how I create them.
		<br><br>
		They also wanted studio pictures of one or more people.

	<h4 class="h4-assignment">TARGET AUDIENCE</h4>
	
	<p>
		Boys and girls aged 13 to 37 (teenagers and millennials) located in urban areas in Norway. The ads are in English to include foreigners as well as Norwegians. They travel by public transportation, and they spend some of their time either hanging in the city or going out on the nightlife.
		<br><br>
		I chose to combine the products (ads and photos of people) by using people in the ads. Since the target audience are aged from 13 to 37 years old, I used a 29-year-old model (my self).
		<br><br>
		I want the ads to convey that this is an online radio station that plays electronica and indie, genres that are popular with the demograph.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">DESIGN</h4>
	
	<p>
		The style is mainly a dark night club theme combined with a 90s feel with the UV-light paint on the side of the face. The glasses are meant as a subtle hint towards hipster style.
		<br><br>
		After editing the pictures they didn’t feel clean enough, so I added a gradient map. It’s a look I’ve seen on a lot of promo-pictures of artists and playlists on Spotify.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">COMPOSITION, LAYOUT, GRID</h4>
	
	<p>
		The whole layout is built with contrast in mind. The face is big to contrast the whitespace on the side. The type is in different sizes to create a hierarchy in addition to contrast. The overall lighting is contrasting and also gives the feeling of being in a nightclub.
		<br><br>
		And since this is an ad for a radio station that may not turn heads, the text is short (easy to remember name and address) big (readability) and edgy (gives the right vibe).
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">TYPOGRAPHY</h4>
	
	<p>
		For guidance I used this Pinterest-post
		<br><br>

		<br><br>
		The used the font Avenir Next Condens for all of the text. It has a condensed bold, strong and modern look.
		<br><br>
		The decision to make it italic was inspired from two photographer I follow on YouTube:

	<h4 class="h4-assignment">COLOURS</h4>
	
	<p>
		For the ads I only used green in different strengths (gradient map), to give it a simplistic and edgy look. Green is said to
		alleviate depression and restore energy, which is exactly what a radio station playing these music genres would do. (See link in the back).
		<br><br>
		The typeface is white to contrasts the dark green background.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">INSPIRATION METHODS</h4>
	
	<p>
		Inspiration for the tasks comes from being amongst the target audience and listening to the same type of music the radio would be playing. I googled electronica and indie, looked at logos for brands and artists; thinking about how to tell the most with a simplistic style in the ads. Electronica is often associated with nightlife and going out to clubs. Indie-music is reckoned as a genre for hipsters. A lot of hipsters tend to wear medium-sized and big glasses, a subtle sign I included in the pictures.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="h4-assignment">CREATIVE METHODS</h4>
	
	<p>
		The photo session was done in my bedroom. Because of dark curtains I have full control over the light sources and can compose the lighting as I wished. I placed my DSLR on a tripod and flipped the LCD screen against me so I could do all the shooting my self.
		<br><br>
		For an artistic and playful touch I drew with a magic marker on my chic and lighted my face with a black light. The light also added light to my face in general. In addition I also used a pocket LED light. I tried both bouncing the light off the wall and facing it directly at my face. Both
		pictures I ended up using have the black light pointing directly at me.
